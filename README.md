# Jobs Vue App


## Application structure:

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) as frontend accessible on http://localhost:8080
- [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/) as backend accessible on http://localhost:3000
- a database [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/index.html)
- [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/en/) as database management tool accessible on http://localhost:8000


## To run the application:

NB: the installation process may take some time

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/marko-droxic/Vue-Nest-Project.git jobs_project
$ cd jobs_project
$ rename .env.example to .env
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Wait a little till all containers build 

Open your default browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

> TODO: add prettier and eslint config, add ts definitions on frontend, Better folder structure


### The Frontend  is made of routes:

- `/`: simply welcome
- `/jobs`: list all the jobs  in database

### Documentation:

- to get the documentation UI: http://localhost:3000/api

## In a nutshell

The front communicates with the backend API via REST
The database is connected to the backend via the package [@nestjs/typeorm](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database).

### Backend

**Backend, is stored in the `server` directory:**

The core of our code is organised as an MVC pattern, and stored into the `src` directory. Files are divided into [controllers](https://docs.nestjs.com/controllers), [modules](https://docs.nestjs.com/modules) and [providers](https://docs.nestjs.com/providers) (including services).

- `main.ts` is the entry file of our application, it creates the server (port 3000) and embed some config.
- `./jobs`: this folder contains module, controller and service to handle the "jobs" feature of our application. The idea of this feature is to save, retrieve, delete jobs from our database. For instance, when the _user controller_ recieves a GET request, it automatically ask the _user service_ to make a database query, which returns all users stored in database. The _controller_ can now create a response and send the content via http body.
- `./config`: this folder contains some backend configuration, mainly credentials to connect to the database.
- `./migration` and `./scripts` contains utilitary functions to manage database, for development.

#### Frontend

**Alright, in the `client` directory**

- `./public`: contains the main html file (index.html) displayed by the browser. It is important to notice here the `<div id="app"></div>`.

- `./src`: contains the core of our application:

    - `main.ts`: Just as NestJS, the main.ts is the entry file of the frontend, it simply "mounts" all html generated by our application in place of the `<div id="app">` in index.html.
    - `App.vue`: is the main vue file, which calls all of the others embedded in the `views` folder (by the mean of [routes](vhttps://v3.vuejs.org/guide/routing.html#official-router)).
    - `./router`: config file which handles routes, used in _App.vue_.
